restore_free_channel: false

# repodata_fns (sequence: primitive)
#   env var string delimiter: ','
#   Specify filenames for repodata fetching. The default is

# use_only_tar_bz2 (NoneType, bool)
#   A boolean indicating that only .tar.bz2 conda packages should be

# ssl_verify (bool, str)
#   aliases: verify_ssl
#   Conda verifies SSL certificates for HTTPS requests, just like a web

#   will fail if a required url's certificate cannot be verified. Setting
#   ssl_verify to False disables certification verification. The value for

#   detected.
#
auto_update_conda: true

# channel_priority (ChannelPriority)
#   Accepts values of 'strict', 'flexible', and 'disabled'. The default
#   value is 'flexible'. With strict channel priority, packages in lower
#   priority channels are not considered if a package with the same name
#   appears in a higher priority channel. With flexible channel priority,
#   the solver may reach into lower priority channels to fulfill
#   dependencies, rather than raising an unsatisfiable error. With channel
#   priority disabled, package version takes precedence, and the
#   configured priority of channels is used only to break ties. In
#   previous versions of conda, this parameter was configured as either
#   True or False. True is now an alias to 'flexible'.

##  Package Linking and Install-time Configuration  ##
######################################################

# allow_softlinks (bool)
#   When allow_softlinks is True, conda uses hard-links when possible, and
#   soft-links (symlinks) when hard-links are not possible, such as when
#   installing on a different filesystem than the one that the package
#   cache is on. When allow_softlinks is False, conda still uses hard-
#   links when possible, but when it is not possible, conda copies files.
#   Individual packages can override this setting, specifying that certain
#   files should never be soft-linked (see the no_link option in the build
#   recipe documentation).
#
allow_softlinks: false

# always_copy (bool)
#   aliases: copy
#   Register a preference that files be copied into a prefix during
#   install rather than hard-linked.
#
always_copy: false

# always_softlink (bool)
#   aliases: softlink
#   Register a preference that files be soft-linked (symlinked) into a
#   prefix during install rather than hard-linked. The link source is the
#   'pkgs_dir' package cache from where the package is being linked.
#   WARNING: Using this option can result in corruption of long-lived
#   conda environments. Package caches are *caches*, which means there is
#   some churn and invalidation. With this option, the contents of
#   environments can be switched out (or erased) via operations on other
#   environments.
#
always_softlink: false

# path_conflict (PathConflict)
#   The method by which conda handle's conflicting/overlapping paths
#   during a create, install, or update operation. The value must be one
#   of 'clobber', 'warn', or 'prevent'. The '--clobber' command-line flag
#   or clobber configuration parameter overrides path_conflict set to

#   Should any error occur during an unlink/link transaction, revert any
#   disk mutations made to that point in the transaction.

# signing_metadata_url_base (NoneType, str)
#   Base URL for obtaining trust metadata updates (i.e., the `*.root.json`

# non_admin_enabled (bool)
#   Allows completion of conda's create, install, update, and remove
#   operations, for non-privileged (non-root or non-administrator) users.
#
non_admin_enabled: true

# separate_format_cache (bool)
#   Treat .tar.bz2 files as different from .conda packages when filenames
#   are otherwise similar. This defaults to False, so that your package
#   cache doesn't churn when rolling out the new package format. If you'd
#   rather not assume that a .tar.bz2 and .conda from the same place
#   represent the same content, set this to True.

separate_format_cache: false

# verify_threads (int)
#   Threads to use when performing the transaction verification step.

#
verify_threads: 0

# execute_threads (int)
